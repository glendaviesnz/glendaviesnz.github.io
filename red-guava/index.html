                <h2>Glen Davies</h2>
                <p>Hi,
                    <br />
                    <br />I am a web application developer with a passion for building user interfaces that people love to work
                    with. I am committed to being the best possible software developer I can be, while still having fun,
                    and being helpful to those I work with (nobody likes a developer with an ego, no matter how good they
                    are!).
                </p>
                <p>I have enterprise level experience in a range of front end technologies, AngularJs, Angular, React, and even
                    a touch of Polymer. While user interfaces are my first love, I am also happy to get my hands dirty with
                    servers and databases, and have experience with a number of different stacks.
                </p>
                <h3>Why Red Guava?</h3>
                <p>After a number of years in the big corporate world I am feeling too many layers removed from the customers,
                    and this role stood out as an opportunity to work with a smaller company and be much more in the loop
                    with the actual users of the software.
                </p>
                <p>To be perfectly honest, the thought of ditching the daily commute, and having more time to commit to interests
                    outside work is pretty appealing also!
                </p>

        <h2>What could I bring to Red Guava?</h2>
        <p>Well, you have a great app already, and I have enjoyed having a look around it. However, the web is an ever changing
            landscape, and I am sure that my pragmatic approach to keeping pace with this changing landscape can help to
            keep Cliniko at the leading edge, but not the bleeding edge (blood stains are hard to get out!).
        </p>
        <p>The Google Lighthouse audit report below shows there is some room for improvement with performance in the mobile
            space, so maybe that would be somewhere for me to start work?

        <p>I shall look forward to discussing the possibilities further with you in person.
